CONTENT:
${contentSnippet}

TOPICS TO COVER:
${topics.map((t, i) => `${i + 1}. ${t}`).join('\n')}

Generate ${count} high-quality flashcard Q&A pairs.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Questions should be CLEAR and test KEY CONCEPTS
2. Answers should be COMPLETE (3-5 sentences)
3. Cover definitions, concepts, processes, and comparisons
4. Mix difficulty: easy (40%), medium (40%), hard (20%)
5. Use "What", "Why", "How", "Define", "Explain" formats

GOOD EXAMPLE:
{
  "question": "What is database normalization and why is it important?",
  "answer": "Database normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It divides larger tables into smaller ones and defines relationships between them. This is important because it eliminates data anomalies, ensures consistency, and makes databases more efficient and maintainable.",
  "category": "Database Design",
  "difficulty": "medium"
}

Output MUST be a valid JSON array with ${count} flashcards.
Format: [{"question":"...","answer":"...","category":"...","difficulty":"easy|medium|hard"}]
